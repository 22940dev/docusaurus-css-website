## 🔑 How do i get an API Key?

You need to fill a form to [Request API Key](https://countrystatecity.in/request). 
_(Note: Make sure you fill the form with valid inputs)_. 
Request will be reviewed by me and validated manually.

---
## 👨‍💻 I am going to use this API for my company/client project, which email should i use in form?

You should be using company's official email or client's official email. Because incase in future there will be some announcments to be made via email. The right person should be receiving it.

---
## 🧐 "Hey, you're taking my personal informations on form", why should i give you?

Yes, i need this information because in future there will be a dashboard portal where you can login and track your API usages and generate a Key by yourself. __(Note: We do not share your data with third party.)__

---
## 🕐 How much time it will take to recieve API Key?

Once your API request is approved you will receive an email with API Key. _(Note: Ideal time to recieve API key is within a Day or Two)_.

---
## 🤓 Can i use this API Key for more than one project?

I should suggest you to use a Unique API Key for your each and every project. That will help us easy to migrate to any new system if any to be implemented in near future.

---
## 🔞 Is there any restrications on usage or How many requests is allowed per minute?

No, there are no such limitations has been kept at the moment to usage of API. You can use it freely but use it **Wisely**.
* Try to keep API responses cached for atleast a day. (Since this data is mostly static in nature and updates quite rarely).
* If you're just using this api to leech the data or copy the data to your database then please consider using direct source of database from here. [CountriesStatesCitiesDB](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database) 

---
## 🆓 Is this API Free forever?

TBH, I really want to keep this API Free Forever for the community but sometimes it needs a little bit of support from the users. If this API does helps you earn some bucks, then please try to [Donate](https://countrystatecity.in/donate) atleast 1% of your earning and I am sure that it will be enough to keep this API alive and Free Forever.

---
## 🤔 How often data source gets updated?

I usually try to resolve data issues in bulk and then push data updates all together to this API. So it all depends on the new release of the Database i make on the repo -- [CountriesStatesCitiesDB](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database)

---
## 🟢 What is the API's uptime?

The API has had an uptime of 99.99% throughout the last 12 months. You can review the current status anytime on the Status Page.

---
## 🧑‍⚖️‍📝 Where can i report data related issues?

Issues are most welcome. As it makes this database more stronger. Feel free to create issue by using this link - [Report an Issue](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database/issues/new)

---
## 🍕 "I need something more in response", Where can i submit my request/suggestions?
